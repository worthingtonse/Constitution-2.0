The Right to Use Tools: Automobiles

  You have probably heard the saying: “Driving is a privilege not a right.” Now imagine telling a handicap person who needs an electric wheelchair to get around “driving your wheelchair is a privilege on not a right.” After all, an electric wheelchair is a type of automobile! Human have legs and must walk to survive (unless of course we have technological substitute) such as car!

  Walking is a human right. Automobiles are extensions of our legs. Humans have a right to drive as much as we have the right to walk.

  Of course it goes without saying that we must not use our Right-to-Drive to infringe on the rights of others. The government has began to take away peoples drivers licenses for things unrelated to driving – such as not paying child support. What’s next? If you want to give me the power to destroy a man, give me the ability to take away his driver’s license.
