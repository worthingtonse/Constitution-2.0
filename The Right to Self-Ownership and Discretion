The Right to Self Ownership and Independence

  The United States of America made one tragic mistake when it formed its constitution – it provided for slavery. All of Jefferson’s words against slavery were struck out of the Declaration of Independence. The effects of this mistake are profound, what should have been the first amendment of the constitution had to wait until 646,000 soldiers were dead or wounded from the civil war and the passage of the 13th Amendment:

13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States

Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.

Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

[Note that the 13th Amendment does not outlaw slavery completely. It seems that under the current law, Americans could legally enslave law-breakers for life and other prisoners for the term of the imprisonment.

  An important natural right was ignored –we the people have a just claim to own ourselves. Self ownership and Independence has wide implications including the following issues:

· Slavery, Serfdom and Debt

· Assisted Suicide (Right to die)

· Prostitution

· Body organ Ownership

· Sexuality, Homosexuality and Transgender issues

· Recreational Drug Use

· Prescription Drug use

  Note that each of these issues is a hot topics and could be the bases for civil wars. However, it is unlikely that any of these issues would be in dispute today had the US included the right to self ownership and self independence in the Bill of Rights.

  Individuals are sovereign and have supreme authority over their own choices and ultimate responsibility of the outcome of their choices. If a person does not have a legal claim on their own body, it seems extraordinary that they may exert a claim on any other property (such as a house). We have only one life to live. It is unethical for others to control our only life.

  The Right to Self Ownership is self-evident as we will act as we so desire unless forced to act differently by an outside force. We experience self-ownership in every waking moment as we control ourselves. We also understand what it means to be denied self ownership. When we are forced to act in ways that we do not want, we become unhappy and often angry. The emotion of anger is directly associated with a loss of control of our own actions.

Furthermore, many laws are designed to restrict a person’s behavior so that they will not act in ways that are foolish. However, while these laws do reduce deaths, it also affects the evolution of mankind -this evolution may be more like devolution.
