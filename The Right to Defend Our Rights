The Right to Defend our Rights

  Rights are paramount to our survival. To defend ones rights is to defend one’s life.

  During the early days of the Soviet Union, men from the KGB would come at night and force Russians into slavery or simply kill them off. Today, many agents of the state –while not killing us directly – will deny us of our rights and make our lives much more difficult. They will use force just as the KGB did. But what justification do they have? Why do we not have the same justification to use force to resist? Did not the Son’s of Liberty tar and feather officials for the same offenses?

  We have the right to defend our rights. What people are justified in using force against us –to control us- we have the same justification have to use force to stop them from controlling us.
