The Right to Cooperate
  Human beings are naturally cooperative with each other but there are limits to our cooperation. Each of us has a just claim to control who and how we cooperate and when we defect from relationships that we do not want to be part of.

  Everyday, we are asked to follow laws. We are to drive on the right side of the street, build our houses with insulation, and follow work regulations. We are to take a large portion of our daily production and give it too governments. In short we are asked to cooperate with our fellow country folk even if it is not in our own personal best interest. At what point do we defect and say no we will not be cooperate? When is it ethical to defect? These are difficult questions and we Americans have long answers these question via Representative democracy. Long have we held that there should be no taxation without representation. Socialists have suggested that we should go to great lengths to cooperate but socialism has failed. Creating a system that decides these questions is paramount to our prosperity.
