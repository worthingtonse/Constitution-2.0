The Right to Use Tools

  Tools are an extension of our own bodies. Clothing extends our skin, cars extend of our legs, Medicine extends our immune systems and fire extends our stomachs. There has never been a human who did not use tools because tools were invented by the species who preceded our evolution. It was tool-use that allowed us to become the dominant species on the planet. Without tools we would all die off. Tools are of paramount importance to our standard of living. We have ownership over our tools just as we have ownership over our own bodies. Governments who have controlled tool ownership generally enslave their citizens.

  Some important tools mentioned in the American constitution include the printing press, the firearm and coin money. Some important tools that were left out include pharmaceuticals and non-metalic money. Here I will discuss the ethics of the following tools:

· Money

· Firearms

· Pharmaceuticals

· Communication devices

· Automobiles

· Fire and Energy

· Capitalism in General
