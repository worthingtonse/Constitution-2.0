The Right to Use Tools: Capital, Money and Wealth

  We the people have the right to be rich, wealthy and prosperous and most importantly to save and invest our money.

  The original definition of capitalism from the 1753 Encyclopédia says capitalism is “The state of one who is rich.” If you are a capitalist, it simply means that you have extra money sitting around that can be invested. Capitalistic countries have people with surplus money and that surplus money can be used to try to figure out more efficient ways of doing things so that society in general can become even richer.

  People have the right to own things including tools, houses, land, money and most importantly themselves. With ownership come all the sovereign decision-making rights that one would expect.
 
  On the flip side, people do not have the right to get rich by fraud or by recieving special privlages from the government. Today we have many rich bankers and finacial types who owe their vast fortunes to bailouts, protections, monopolies and special treatments handed out by congress at the expense of all the rest of us.
Wealth Note: Nations that are capitalistic (allowing people to become richer than other people) are infinitely more prosperous than those nations that do not. Achieving the most ethical capitalism is of paramount importance. See the chapter on The Most Ethical Capitalism.
