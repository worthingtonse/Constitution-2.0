  As humans, we have a nature. We are thinking animals. We have evolved with large brains that allow us to survive in a variety of habitats. Since the age of Reason and the American Revolution of 1776, fueled by the deist philosophies of John Locke, Tomas Jefferson and Tomas Payne, liberal societies have come to understand that reason and rational thought are the most ethical means for us to organize and rule ourselves. 
  In stark contrast are the Islamic Jihadists who believe that their magic book gives them the authority to slaughter anyone who dares so much as draw a cartoon of their leader. We rational Americans understand that we must debate all aspects of the decisions we make and look carefully at the facts, keeping our emotions at bay, resisting mindless religious and political ideology and instead embrace reason. We must be skeptical and question everything. When someone (Teacher, Parent, Preacher and Politician) tells us what is true -do not just accept it. Look at what the critics say and examine all sides of the argument. 
    As Thomas Paine said, we must not think that something is true just because it is tradition. Remember that solutions to problems sometimes seem very strange at first. If the solutions were obvious, we may have thought of them long ago. Do not avoid conflict. We must challenge each other’s thinking. We Americans questioned everything during the 1776 revolution with good results.
  Let us start by declaring who we are and what we want. Begin with the end in mind -Stephan R. Covey
  
  “All of us were born of two parents, and are equipped with bodies of a recognizable and distinctive kind – two arms, two legs, we walk erect, and so on. The ‘and so on’ takes quite a range.” ..Jan Narveson author of This Is Ethical Theory.
