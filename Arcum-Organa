There are organs in our bodies called "Vestigial" that are remnants from our evolutinary past and serve us no purpose. These include the Wisdom Teath, appendix, tail bone. 
But there are other organs in our bodies that are the very reason that we are here. They help us fill the niche that would otherwise be dominated by other anima.s

I have not found a name for these organs so I had to make one up. I call them "Arcum-organa." Arcum is latin for the bow of a ship and organa means organs. 
Our Arcum-Organa include our large brains, voice boxes, thumbs for tool use feet designed for waling on two feet. It is from the Arum-organa that
people's rights originate. The Arcum-Organa are the rights of men.
