Marriage is an institution that has probably only been around for 5,000 years and may go extinks in the near future.

However, in the time that it has been around - including today - it is the most effiecent way of running houshold and increasing the quality of life of family members.  

Marriage is left up to the individual including polygamy, homosexual marriages.
