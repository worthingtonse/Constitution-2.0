The Right to Offspring

  Who owns your sperm (or eggs) and DNA? Who says how many children you can have? In China, people like you are only allowed to have 1 baby. Unless you are rich and pay some bribe. A sovereign people will make the choice without interference from others.

  More controversial is the issue of DNA. If you donâ€™t have a just claim to your own DNA, then who does? Why is human cloning illegal? What gives anyone the right to make this illegal?
