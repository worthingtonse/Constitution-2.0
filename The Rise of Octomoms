  Is she crazy? No…sadly we are the crazy ones. She is the great mother. The great procreator. She is the great cuckoo bird that has layed her eggs in our nests so that her brood can deign our children of life at their expense.  And she could not have done it alone. There is an entire system that has been created in order to make it possible. This system is made up of tax agents, beuracracies and public servants. 

She is either so smart, or so lucky that she has figured out how to legally take all of our money. While we pay 30% of our earnings to income, sales, property and other taxes… she  receives millions of those taxes and we must contain our reproduction because we cannot afford it to have so many babies.

 

She is the enemy of all taxpayers with children. There will be 30 children per classroom and eight of them will be hers.

The doctors got rich. The government got rich. The Unilities got rich. We got oppressed. We became poorer, even as we made more money.

This will be the new evolution if not checked.
